nums [7, 12, 34, 12, 67, 5]
pivot = 12

use swaps
have two pointers

count number of elements smaller or equal

make a permutation table

linked list would be quite proper
but in the end we have to convert to array
and conversion will be costly

nums          [7, 12, 34, 12, 67, 5], 12
result        [7, 5, 12, 12, 34, 67]

permutation   [0, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1]
